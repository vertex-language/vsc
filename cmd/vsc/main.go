// Command vsc is the Vertex compiler.
//
// It has nothing of its own: everything it does is cli.Run, which is
// a wrapper over the vsc package, which is the phases composed. Three
// lines here rather than none because a command is a module's entry
// point and a library is not, and keeping them apart is what lets a
// program embed the compiler without embedding the command.
