// The Windows toolchain is two installations, not one. The MSVC
// toolset carries the compiler's own libraries — the vcruntime, the
// intrinsic helpers — and the Windows SDK carries the platform's:
// ucrt, which is the C standard library and therefore malloc, and um,
// which is the Win32 API and therefore kernel32. Both are versioned,
// side by side, under directories named for the version, and neither
// can be named without being looked up.
//
// vcvars64.bat resolves both into %LIB%, and where it has there is
// nothing to do. Where it has not — an ordinary shell, or a Developer
// Command Prompt whose SDK half came up empty, which is what a
// machine whose SDK was installed outside the Visual Studio installer
// gets — vsc finds them the way the platform's own tools do, and the
// rest of this file is that walk.
//
// It is vcc's, in its library half. The two compilers link against
// the same two installations on the same machines, and a rule that
// was written twice is a rule that will be fixed once.

// windowsLibraryDirs is LibraryDirs' Windows half: %LIB% first, then
// what vsc finds, deduplicated.
//
// %LIB% comes first because it is what a vcvars environment answers
// this question with, so honouring it means vsc composes inside one,
// and a caller who set it by hand has said which libraries to use.
//
// What vsc finds itself is appended rather than substituted, because
// %LIB% is not always the whole answer: vcvars derives its SDK half
// from a registry value its own installer does not always write, and
// the Developer Command Prompt that results holds the toolset and no
// ucrt anywhere in it. Appending repairs that shell without overriding
// it — a directory the environment already named is not repeated, so a
// complete %LIB% leaves nothing to add.
//
// A target this host has no architecture name for gets neither
// installation's libraries, which is the same answer
// DefaultLibraries gives it.
